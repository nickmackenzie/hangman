**Don't Fall Off The Waterfall**

**This is defiantly a full screen game. Who uses phones anyways ðŸ˜Š**


**How to play:**

This is my take on hangman. There are two modes. Normal mode is a single round game mode. It gives you a word, and given the length of the word, thats how many guess you have to solve it. You enter a single letter and press enter to see if the character matches in the word.


> **Example:** "Dogs" --- This would would give you 4 chances.

Arcade mode is a bit different as it includes multiple rounds. The number of chances is represented by the heart containers. If you lose all your hearts or if the timer runs out, you lose and start back at level 1.

**Tips:** 
 - You can click the raccoon on the right hand side to get a hint anytime.
 - There are trophies that you can collect in the game. Try hovering over the trophy to see how you can achieve it.

**Technologies Used:**

 - HTML, CSS, JS
 - Google Fonts
 - FontAwesome
 - Lottie Player JS
 - animista.net
 - [Speech Bubble Maker](https://projects.verou.me/bubbly/)

**Next Steps:**
I would like refactor the code a bit better with the way I share functions with the normal mode and arcade mode. I basically just copied and pasted my whole JS file twice to get the two modes and I think there might be a better way to do this. Also, I feel like my trophy system needs some tweaking because I feel like that script running every ten seconds slows down my machine after awhile. 

**Bugs/Errors:**
When the first trophy appears, it creates a huge empty space at the bottom of the web page. It also shifts the the whole entire game a bit. This only happens once. I would like to try and solve that.
