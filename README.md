**Don't Fall Off The Waterfall**

**This is defiantly a full screen game. Who uses phones anyways 😊**
This is my take on hangman. There are two mode. Normal mode is a single round game mode. It gives you a word, and given the length of the word, thats how many guess you have to solve it. You enter a single letter and press enter to see if the character matches in the word.


> **Example:** "Dogs" --- This would would give you 4 chances.

Arcade mode is a bit different as it includes multiple rounds. The number of chances is represented by the heart containers. If you lose all your hearts or if the timer runs out, you lose and start back at level 1.
**Tips:** 
 - You can click the raccoon on the right hand side to get a hint anytime.
 - There are trophies that you can collect in the game. Try hovering over the trophy to see how you can achieve it.

**Technologies Used:**

 - HTML, CSS, JS

**Next Steps:**
I would like refactor the code a bit better with the way I share functions with the normal mode and arcade mode. I basically just copied and pasted my whole JS file twice to get the two modes and I think there might be a better way to do this. Also, I feel like my trophy system needs some tweaking because I feel like that script running every ten seconds slows down my machine after awhile.
